##### Symptom


- When the proper format was followed but the content between the parenthesis was not a link, it would print out the content between the parenthesis. Since this was not a real link, it should have just returned "[]". In order to fix this, we used the "contains()" method to see if there was any empty space between the parethesis, if there was, that meant this was not a link and the loop should break and return nothing.
